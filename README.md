This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in assembly code. The `bug.asm` file demonstrates the vulnerable code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version. The vulnerability arises from adding a constant value to a memory address without checking if it exceeds the allocated buffer size.  This can lead to unpredictable behavior, program crashes, or security exploits.
